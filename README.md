### Welcome to the Country Data Finder!

I made this Web App using React.js, JSX and CSS. I thought it would be interesting to be able to view some facts about countries that are fetched from an API. For this particular project, I used an API called ["Rest Countries API"](https://restcountries.com/), and fetched data from it such as the Common Name, Official Name, Population, Region, Subregion, Flag, Capital, Continent, and Time Zones.

I adapted some of the code from the code-alongs that we did in class and added my own features in order to create a seamless app that fetches from the Rest Countries API.

I also made sure that the search was a fulltext search.

As mentioned in the Homework #2 requirements page, this app has the following features:

- Uses a gradient in the info and form component.
- Uses grid in the overall layout, and flex in individual components.
- Responsive layout that adjusts depending on the size of the screen.
- Has one image on either side of the form.
- Visually balanced and has color contrast with aligned components.
- Was run through a HTML and accessibility validator.
- Has a prettier file that formats code.
